# Answer to exercise 2.72

## Order of growth
Assume we use the procedure `encode-symbol` in exercise 2.68, to encode the most frequent symbol, it only needs to search the left branch once, and it takes `O(1)` time since there is just 
one symbol in the left branch. If we want to encode the least frequent symbol, we need to search every node before we reach the last node. Since at every node it takes `O(n)` time and there 
is `n - 1` nodes to search, the overall complexity would be `O(n^2)` to encode the least frequent symbol.
