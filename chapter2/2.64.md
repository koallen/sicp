# Answer to exercise 2.64

## Explanation
The procedure first calculate the number of elements in the left tree and generate the left 
tree. Meanwhile, it obtains the remaining elements and calculates the size of the right tree. 
After that, the first element in the remaining elements becomes the entry element and the right 
tree is generated. In the end, a tree is made with `make-tree`.

The above procedure is executed recursively and stops when there is no element for tree generation.

## Produced tree
```
          5
        /   \
       1     9
        \   / \
         3 7   11
```

## Order of growth
This procedure loops over the given list of elements, thus its order of growth is `O(n)`.
