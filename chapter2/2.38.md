# Answer to exercise 2.38

## Values of evaluation
```
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3)) => 1/6

(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3)) => 3/2

(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3)) => (1 (2 (3)))

(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3)) => (((1) 2) 3)
```

## Property of op
I think `op` should satisfy that the order of parameters doesnâ€™t affect 
the result. In other words, `(op x y)` should be the same as `(op y x)`.
