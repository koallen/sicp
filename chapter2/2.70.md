# Answer to exercise 2.70

## Message encoding
This song takes 84 bits to be encoded with Huffman encoding.

## Fixed-length encoding
To encode 8 symbols with fixed-length encoding, we need to represent each symbol with 3 bits. Therefore, this song needs 108 bits to be encoded. 
We can see that itâ€™s not as efficient as Huffman encoding.
