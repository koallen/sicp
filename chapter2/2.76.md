# Answer to exercise 2.76

## Explicit dispatch
To add a new type, we need to change all the procedures which is associated with this new type.

To add a new operation, we need to write a new procedure that implements that operation for this 
type.

## Data-directed style
To add a new type, we need to write a new procedure that installs it to the table.

To add a new operation, we need to add a procedure in the install procedure and update the table.

## Message-passing style
To add a new type, we need to define a new procedure for that type.

To add a new operation, we need to add it as a branch in `cond` in the type definition procedure.

## Most appropriate style
Explicit dispatch is not a good choice because it is not additive. Both data-directed style and 
message-passing style are good for the purpose of adding a new type or operation.
