# Answer to exercise 2.63

## Difference between the two procedures
They produce the same result for every tree, because they are all in-order traversal. 
For the first tree in figure 2.16, the result is `(1 3 5 7 9 11)`.

## Growth of the algorithms
The first one calls `append`, which is quite heavy compared to `cons`. After calculation, the 
order of growth for the first procedure is `O(n*log(n))`, and that for the second procedure is 
`O(n)`.
