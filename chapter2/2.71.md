# Answer to exercise 2.71

## Sketch of the tree
The tree is not shown here.

## Bits to encode
To encode the most frequent symbol, Huffman encoding always uses just 1 bit. As for the least frequent symbol, 
it takes `n - 1` bits to encode because when the tree is built, one symbol is merged every time. There is no merging 
of two symbol sets. Therefore the tree depth is `n - 1`.
