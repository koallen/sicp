# Answer to exercise 2.77

## Why it works
Before we add those lines, no `magnitude` procedure is associated with the type `complex`. After we add 
those lines of code, `apply-generic` can find the right procedure for `complex` type objects.

## Tracing
When we call `magnitude`, it calls `apply-generic` and it finds the procedure `magnitude` again. Then the 
procedure is called on the specific form of complex number (tag `complex` is stripped off). This time, 
`apply-generic` is called again and it finds the actual implementation of `magnitude`. Thus the magnitude 
is returned.

`apply-generic` is called twice, stripping off a tag each time itâ€™s called.
