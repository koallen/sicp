# Answer to exercise 2.9

## Sum and difference
Suppose we have two intervals `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`. The width for these intervals should be `(b - a) / 2` and `(d - c) / 2`.
The sum of the interval is `(a + c, b + d)`, so the width would be `(b + d - a - c) / 2`. This is exactly the sum of the width of 
the two intervals. The same can be proven for difference.

## Multiplication and division
Suppose we have two intervals `a` and `b`. And `a` is `(1, 3)`, while `b` is `(4, 5)`. 
Now the multiplication of the two intervals gives us `(4, 15)`, with a width of `5.5` 
If the width of a multiplication is a function of the width of original intervals, we should 
get the same width for multiplication if we use another pair of intervals with the same width as 
`a` and `b`.

If we have `c` as `(2, 4)` and d as `(1, 2)`, the width of the multiplication is `3`. This is obviously 
different from `5.5` above. Thus this is not true for multiplication. The same can be shown for division.
