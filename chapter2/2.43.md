# Answer to exercise 2.43

## Program analysis
In the original program, it will first obtain safe positions with `k - 1` queens. Then it uses 
`flatmap` to test placing a new queen in column `k`.

If the program that Louis has, it’s a bit different. For each position in the `kth` column, 
it computes safe positions with `k - 1` queens. Obviously, it’s not necessary to compute that 
once for each position. The safe positions should only be calculated once for testing the 
placement of new queen.

Therefore, if the board size is `k`, it would take `k^T` time for Louis’ program to finish.
