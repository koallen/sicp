# Answer to exercise 3.39

If we protect `(* x x)` and `(set! x (+ x 1))` from each other using the serializer, we can still 
get four possible results. These results are:
- 121
- 101
- 100
- 11

A lot of answers online didnâ€™t include the possibility of 11. This is actually very tricky. Notice 
that part of the first procedure is not protected. Therefore, it can interleave with protected procedures. 
And because of this, the original situation where 11 can occur is still valid.
