# Answer to exercise 3.46

If the `test-and-set!` procedure is not atomic, this is what will happen:
- Process A calls `test-and-set!` and the cell is false.
- Process B also calls `test-and-set!` and the cell is false.
- Process A now set the cell as true.
- Process B also set the cell as true.
- Both process A and B acquired the mutex and continues their execution.

As we can see, the mutex is useless.
