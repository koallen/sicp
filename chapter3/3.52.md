# Answer to exercise 3.52

The value of sum after evaluation of the expressions are:
- 0
- 1
- 6
- 10
- 136
- 210

The printed response for `(stream-ref y 7)` is:
```
136
```

The printed response for `(display-stream z)` is:
```
10
15
45
55
105
120
190
210
```

The response would differ because without memoization, we will call accum twice for some x. Thus, 
the sum would be different.
