# Answer to exercise 3.27

## 3rd Fibonacci number
When we use memoization, Fib(1) ,Fib(2), and Fib(3) are all computed once first recursively. After that, 
the rest of the computation are made by looking up the table. Therefore, this algorithm has O(n) steps.

## Alternative definition
The definition won’t work. This is because `fib` doesn’t call `memo-fib` and therefore won’t access the table.
