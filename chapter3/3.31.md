# Answer to exercise 3.31

## Necessity
The procedure should immediately run because when a function box is added, the signal should start 
propagating through it. Otherwise, unless we change the input, the output might not be correct.

## Difference
For the case of this half-adder, if we donâ€™t call the procedure when we build the adder, the output of 
inverter will be 0 (since wire is initialized to be 0). However, the correct value should be 1. And since 
during the propagation, the input of the inverter is never changed, the output will not be changed either. 
This would result in a wrong input for the and-gate after the inverter, causing the final result to be 
incorrect.
