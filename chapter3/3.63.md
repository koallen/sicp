# Answer to exercise 3.63

Reasoner’s solution is less efficient because every time `sqrt-stream` is called, it creates a new stream. 
Thus, we have to compute the elements of stream again and again as we compute elements in the original stream. 

If we don’t use memoization, then we would also need to compute elements of a stream again and again, although 
we are operating on the same stream.
