# Answer to exercise 3.34

In Louis’ implementation of `squarer`, he connects the same connector `a` to a multiplier twice. 
For the computation of `b` from `a`, there won’t be any problem. However, if he tries to compute `a` 
from `b`, he will fail to do that. This is because when `b` is set, not enough information is given 
to set value for `a`. Thus the constraint propagation system fails.
