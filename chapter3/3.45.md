# Answer to exercise 3.45

If we serialize `withdraw` and `deposit` when we dispatch it, and also serialize `exchange`. Then `exchange` 
would contain the serialized version of `withdraw` and `deposit`. Since all these procedures are serialized 
with the same serializer, our process will freeze when we try to execute one serialized procedure inside 
another one.
