# Answer to exercise 1.9

## First procedure
The generated process is as follow, it is a recursive process.
```Scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

## Second procedure
The generated process is as follow, it is a iterative process.
```Scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```
