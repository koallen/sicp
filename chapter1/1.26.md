# Answer to exercise 1.26

The difference has to do with the evaluation of the procedure. If we use `square`, `expmod` is only evaluated once. 
If we use explicit multiplication, `expmod` is actually evaluated twice each time we square it. And now it becomes 
a tree recursive process. Therefore, the order growth is now O(n) instead of O(log n).
